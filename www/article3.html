            <p>From small toys to food, batteries, buttons and beyond, the world can suddenly seem full of choking 
                hazards and a scary place for a parent.  As they say, knowledge is power, and in the case of a child 
                choking, ; knowing what to do really can make the difference between life and death. We’ve put together 
                some situations where a child may show signs of choking and prepared a guide showing you what to do:
        
                <div class="scenario">
            <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Babies love to explore new objects with their mouths. Whether it is to examine new tastes or textures, or to help little teeth emerge, mouthing is a great experience for your baby, but there is always a risk your baby may swallow something which can block their windpipe. 
            </p>
            <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br> Ensure that any play objects are safe, unbreakable and are too big to fit inside the mouth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario">
            <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Your baby is weaning, you may find that your baby occasionally gags on even the most pureed food. The sensitive gag reflex allows the food to move forward into the mouth and it’s quite normal.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="img/child2.jpg" id="child2">
        <div class="scenario">
            <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> If an object or food does get stuck in the throat and your baby is coughing, it is called ‘partial blockage’.  
            </p>
            <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br>  Remember, if your baby can cough then it means their airway is not fully blocked. You should let them continue to cough to completely clear the blockage, watching them closely. If at any time they become unable to cough, cry or breathe you need to follow the advice in the next scenario. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario">
            <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Your baby is unable to cough, cry or breathe – this means they are showing signs of choking.
            </p>
            <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br>Call for help as soon as possible on 999 stating ‘Ambulance services’, if you are alone use your phone on hands-free, telling the operator you are on your own – they will send an ambulance and support you while you complete the following steps: </p>

    
            <p><a class="colBody">1.</a> Sit down and lay baby face down along your thigh supporting their head.</p>
            <p><a class="colBody">2.</a> Give up to five sharp blows between their shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</p>
            <p><a class="colBody">3.</a> Check the mouth for the object. If you can confidently pick it out with your fingertips then do so, but take great care not to push it in further.</p>
            <p><a class="colBody">4.</a> If the back blows do not clear the blockage, turn your baby to lay face up along the length of your thigh.</p>
            <p><a class="colBody">5.</a> Give up to five chest thrusts: put two fingers just below the centre of the chest and push inwards up to five times.</p>
            <p><a class="colBody">6.</a> Continue to check their mouth regularly and remove the object if possible. If choking persists, repeat back blows and chest thrusts until you dislodge the object and they can breathe.</li>

        <p>Although these situations can be very frightening children are very resilient and knowing how to react will make you feel more prepared. Getting the knowledge and skills for how to react in these situations is the best way to reduce these anxieties – being prepared is always best.
