            <h4>WHAT ARE MY CHOICES?</h4>
            <img src="img/decision1.png" id="decision1">
            <p>All choices regarding your pregnancy, labour and birth are yours to make, and is supported by 
                the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights/human-rights-act" class="colMind">Human Rights Act</a>. Learning how to make decisions for you is really important part of taking 
                control of your health and wellbeing. Your healthcare team are there to provide you with non-biased 
                evidence based information and support you to make decisions about your care. While it is not 
                possible to plan for every event that may happen, these decision making tools can help you feel 
                confident and in control as they arise.</p>
            <h4>B.R.A.I.N.S</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21831558/" class="colMind">B.R.A.I.N.S</a> acronym lays out an approach you can use when you need to make a decision about your care:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> <a class="colMind"> B  enefits</a> - why is the treatment being recommended and what are the benefits associated with it?</li>
                <li> <a class="colMind">R isks</a> – are there any risks associated for me or my baby, now or in the future?</li>
                <br>
                <li> <a class="colMind">A lternatives</a> – what are the other options and what are their risks and benefits?</li>
                <br>
                <li> <a class="colMind">I ntuition</a> – what do you feel about the options? Do you have a ‘gut feeling’ </li>
                <br>
                <li> <a class="colMind">N othing</a> – what happens if you wait or choose to do nothing?                </li>
                <br>
                <li> <a class="colMind">S top and think</a> – And breathe. Now you have the information take a moment, or as long as you need before 
                    you decide what you’d like to do.  </li>
                </ul>
                
                <img src="img/decision2.jpg" id="decision2">
            <p>This is an excellent tool to both help you to make decisions about your care, especially when an intervention is 
                being advised which you hadn’t maybe planned for. Intuition is possibly the hardest option to consider for many 
                of us as modern living often means that the answer is at our fingertips. Intuition is not necessarily a skill 
                that we rely on to make decisions or practice in our daily lives meaning it is a bit of a lost art. This is where 
                the stop and think comes in. Although there are some scenarios in pregnancy, labour and birth where a decision 
                needs to be made quickly, most of the time it’s possible to go over all your options again, talk them through 
                and recognise what your ‘gut feeling’ is when you have all the information. </p>
            <h4>ASK 3 QUESTIONS</h4>
            
            <p>Ask 3 Questions is a shared decision making tool, which can help you make choices about your care:            </p>
            <ul class="numbers">
                <li class="colMind">What are my options?</li>
                <br>
                <li class="colMind">What are the pros and cons of each option?</li>
                <br>
                <li class="colMind"> How do I get support to help me make a decision that is right for me?</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h4>NEED MORE INFORMATION?</h4>
            <img src="img/decision3.jpg" id="decision3">
            <p>It can feel a bit intimidating making choices for your health, in order to feel confident doing this you need 
                to feel informed so that you can weigh up the options for your individual circumstances. For any care offered 
                healthcare professionals should always explain fully, providing the reasons why it is recommended and gain 
                your consent so that you can choose what you want.  If for any reason they cannot provide this information, 
                or you don’t feel comfortable with their approach you can choose to speak to another provider. <a class="colMind">The RISE HQ HUB</a>
                gives information on a wide range of health and wellbeing in collaboration with experts to make sure it is 
                evidence based. This removes the guess work and need to search the internet to find exactly what you’re looking for. 
                All of our courses and classes focus on making you feel confident and in control so that whatever direction your 
                pregnancy, labour and birth journey takes you it can be a positive experience.
