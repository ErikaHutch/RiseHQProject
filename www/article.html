        <!--Article title-->
        <!--Article contents-->
        <div>
            <p>Gender based violence (GBV) and abuse describes a range of oppressive acts which cover a spectrum of violence 
                and abuse committed primarily but not exclusively against women. GBV continues to exist due to social inequality 
                between men and women. Both financial and societal vulnerability created by inequality andans societal conditioning 
                around accepted behaviour mean that women are more likely to experience both GBV and sustained abuse. 
                There are many forms of abuse which affect women and girls because of their gender including, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> Domestic abuse - financial dependency, threat or use of physical or sexual violence or psychological or emotional manipulation</li>
                <li> Sexual violence, abuse and exploitation </li>
                <li> Female genital mutilation</li>
                <li> Forced marriage </li>
                <li> ‘Honour’ based violence </li>
                <li> Stalking </li>
                <li> Trafficking </li>
                </ul>

            <p>People may experience one or multiple forms of oppression, and can happen in person, over the phone or online. 
                Certain groups are more vulnerable to this kind of behaviour and can face additional barriers to getting help. 
                These include but are not exclusive to <a href="https://stepupmigrantwomen.org/2019/05/23/research-righttobebelieved/" class="colSelf">migrant women</a>, 
                <a href="http://www.galop.org.uk/" class="colSelf">LGBTQI groups</a>, <a href="https://www.imkaan.org.uk/" class="colSelf">black women and ethnically minoritised people</a> 
                and those with <a href="http://staysafe-east.org.uk/index.php/domestic-and-sexual-violence/" class="colSelf">physical or mental disability</a>. 
                Domestic abuse and violence can also affect <a href="https://mensadviceline.org.uk/" class="colSelf">men</a> and due to stigma as well as fear are less likely to seek help – you are not alone and help is available.  </p>
            <p>HOW TO KNOW IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING GBV</p>

                it could be that the other person is behaving abusively. This list from Women’s Aid identifies common behaviours
