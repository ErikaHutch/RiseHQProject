    <div>
        <p>Gender based violence (GBV) and abuse describes a range of oppressive acts which cover a spectrum of violence 
            and abuse committed primarily but not exclusively against women. GBV continues to exist due to social inequality 
            between men and women. Both financial and societal vulnerability created by inequality andans societal conditioning 
            around accepted behaviour mean that women are more likely to experience both GBV and sustained abuse. 
            There are many forms of abuse which affect women and girls because of their gender including, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Domestic abuse - financial dependency, threat or use of physical or sexual violence or psychological or emotional manipulation</li>
            <br>
            <li> Sexual violence, abuse and exploitation </li>
            <br>
            <li> Female genital mutilation</li>
            <br>
            <li> Forced marriage </li>
            <br>
            <li> ‘Honour’ based violence </li>
            <br>
            <li> Stalking </li>
            <br>
            <li> Trafficking </li>
            </ul>

        <p>People may experience one or multiple forms of oppression, and can happen in person, over the phone or online. 
            Certain groups are more vulnerable to this kind of behaviour and can face additional barriers to getting help. 
            These include but are not exclusive to <a href="https://stepupmigrantwomen.org/2019/05/23/research-righttobebelieved/" class="colSelf">migrant women</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.galop.org.uk/" class="colSelf">LGBTQI groups</a>, <a href="https://www.imkaan.org.uk/" class="colSelf">black women and ethnically minoritised people</a> 
            and those with <a href="http://staysafe-east.org.uk/index.php/domestic-and-sexual-violence/" class="colSelf">physical or mental disability</a>. 
            Domestic abuse and violence can also affect <a href="https://mensadviceline.org.uk/" class="colSelf">men</a> and due to stigma as well as fear are less likely to seek help – you are not alone and help is available.  </p>
        <h4>HOW TO KNOW IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING GBV</h4>
        <img src="img/abuse2.png" id="abuse2">
        <p>The most difficult step is coming to terms with the fact that you or someone you know is experiencing abuse. 
            Although every situation is unique, if you do not feel comfortable or something just doesn’t feel right, 
            it could be that the other person is behaving abusively. This list from Women’s Aid identifies common behaviours 
            for those experiencing GBV:</p>

        <h4>HOW TO GET HELP</h4>
        <img src="img/abuse3.png" id="abuse3">
        <p>The <a href="http://www.healthscotland.scot/health-topics/gender-based-violence/gender-based-violence-overview/routine-enquiry-of-abuse" class="colSelf">routine enquiry</a> has been set up in all maternity, sexual health, health visiting, substance use and mental health settings to ensure that all pregnant people  are asked if they 
            are experiencing abuse. This query should always be made when you are alone to make sure you are safe and able to talk and ideally the first time they see you. All professionals are 
            trained to identify behaviours indicating they could be experiencing domestic violence or abuse and may enquire outside of these areas if they have concerns. However if you are 
            experiencing GBV or abuse please don’t wait to be asked but seek help. There are many organisations set up to help to help in a sensitive and safe way to protect you and anyone in 
            your household who is affected. Our contact list below includes organisations for each country in the UK and the groups they are specifically set up to help.</p>

            evidence based information and support you to make decisions about your care. While it is not 
            possible to plan for every event that may happen, these decision making tools can help you feel 
            confident and in control as they arise.</p>
        <h4>B.R.A.I.N.S</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21831558/" class="colMind">B.R.A.I.N.S</a> acronym lays out an approach you can use when you need to make a decision about your care:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> <a class="colMind"> B  enefits</a> - why is the treatment being recommended and what are the benefits associated with it?</li>
            <li> <a class="colMind">R isks</a> – are there any risks associated for me or my baby, now or in the future?</li>
            <br>
            <li> <a class="colMind">A lternatives</a> – what are the other options and what are their risks and benefits?</li>
            <br>
            <li> <a class="colMind">I ntuition</a> – what do you feel about the options? Do you have a ‘gut feeling’ </li>
            <br>
            <li> <a class="colMind">N othing</a> – what happens if you wait or choose to do nothing?                </li>
            <br>
            <li> <a class="colMind">S top and think</a> – And breathe. Now you have the information take a moment, or as long as you need before 
                you decide what you’d like to do.  </li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="img/decision2.jpg" id="decision2">
        <p>This is an excellent tool to both help you to make decisions about your care, especially when an intervention is 
            being advised which you hadn’t maybe planned for. Intuition is possibly the hardest option to consider for many 
            of us as modern living often means that the answer is at our fingertips. Intuition is not necessarily a skill 
            that we rely on to make decisions or practice in our daily lives meaning it is a bit of a lost art. This is where 
            the stop and think comes in. Although there are some scenarios in pregnancy, labour and birth where a decision 
            needs to be made quickly, most of the time it’s possible to go over all your options again, talk them through 
            and recognise what your ‘gut feeling’ is when you have all the information. </p>
        <h4>ASK 3 QUESTIONS</h4>
        
        <p>Ask 3 Questions is a shared decision making tool, which can help you make choices about your care:            </p>
        <ul class="numbers">

            <li class="colMind"> How do I get support to help me make a decision that is right for me?</li>

        <img src="img/decision3.jpg" id="decision3">
        <p>It can feel a bit intimidating making choices for your health, in order to feel confident doing this you need 
            to feel informed so that you can weigh up the options for your individual circumstances. For any care offered 
            healthcare professionals should always explain fully, providing the reasons why it is recommended and gain 
            your consent so that you can choose what you want.  If for any reason they cannot provide this information, 
            or you don’t feel comfortable with their approach you can choose to speak to another provider. <a class="colMind">The RISE HQ HUB</a>
            gives information on a wide range of health and wellbeing in collaboration with experts to make sure it is 
            evidence based. This removes the guess work and need to search the internet to find exactly what you’re looking for. 
            All of our courses and classes focus on making you feel confident and in control so that whatever direction your 
            pregnancy, labour and birth journey takes you it can be a positive experience.

        <p>From small toys to food, batteries, buttons and beyond, the world can suddenly seem full of choking 
            hazards and a scary place for a parent.  As they say, knowledge is power, and in the case of a child 
            choking, ; knowing what to do really can make the difference between life and death. We’ve put together 
            some situations where a child may show signs of choking and prepared a guide showing you what to do:
    <p></p>
            <div class="scenario">
        <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Babies love to explore new objects with their mouths. Whether it is to examine new tastes or textures, or to help little teeth emerge, mouthing is a great experience for your baby, but there is always a risk your baby may swallow something which can block their windpipe. 
        </p>
        <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br> Ensure that any play objects are safe, unbreakable and are too big to fit inside the mouth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Your baby is weaning, you may find that your baby occasionally gags on even the most pureed food. The sensitive gag reflex allows the food to move forward into the mouth and it’s quite normal.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img src="img/child2.jpg" id="child2">
    <div class="scenario">
        <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> If an object or food does get stuck in the throat and your baby is coughing, it is called ‘partial blockage’.  
        </p>
        <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br>  Remember, if your baby can cough then it means their airway is not fully blocked. You should let them continue to cough to completely clear the blockage, watching them closely. If at any time they become unable to cough, cry or breathe you need to follow the advice in the next scenario. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="scenario">
        <p><a class="colBody">Scenario:</a><br> Your baby is unable to cough, cry or breathe – this means they are showing signs of choking.
        </p>
        <p><a class="colBody">What to do:</a><br>Call for help as soon as possible on 999 stating ‘Ambulance services’, if you are alone use your phone on hands-free, telling the operator you are on your own – they will send an ambulance and support you while you complete the following steps: </p>


        <p><a class="colBody">1.</a> Sit down and lay baby face down along your thigh supporting their head.</p>
        <p><a class="colBody">2.</a> Give up to five sharp blows between their shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</p>
        <p><a class="colBody">3.</a> Check the mouth for the object. If you can confidently pick it out with your fingertips then do so, but take great care not to push it in further.</p>
        <p><a class="colBody">4.</a> If the back blows do not clear the blockage, turn your baby to lay face up along the length of your thigh.</p>
        <p><a class="colBody">5.</a> Give up to five chest thrusts: put two fingers just below the centre of the chest and push inwards up to five times.</p>
        <p><a class="colBody">6.</a> Continue to check their mouth regularly and remove the object if possible. If choking persists, repeat back blows and chest thrusts until you dislodge the object and they can breathe.</li>
        </div>
        <img src="img/child3.png" id="child3">
    <p>Although these situations can be very frightening children are very resilient and knowing how to react will make you feel more prepared. Getting the knowledge and skills for how to react in these situations is the best way to reduce these anxieties – being prepared is always best.
